- Gather the bin points from the rest of the image (using range, colour edges, maybe colour transforms) Gabriel
- initialize seed planes from a single frame - could average seed planes, just as long as each one is built from only a single image, to minimize blurring.
 (built by region growing)
- separate the points into the two planes, as per the seed plane, for each image
- discard outliers from the planes in each image
- Transform the points into a single 3D point set, using Iterative Closest Point Thomas
-accept edges for icp
- Fit two planes for the whole 3d Dataset - the points have already been split between two planes
-project each point to plane
-provide angle between planes

Weird things
- Produce the following images: frontal view, top view, both coloured and plain
- Produce zoomed image of the leftmost white square, orientating it perpendicular to view
- Report the average and standard deviation of the angle between the box in each frame, and the box chosen as a frame of reference
- Report statistics of average distance from plane when:
	for each frame
		add to point set, fit a plane, report distance of all points 			to this plane
- Write Report!
